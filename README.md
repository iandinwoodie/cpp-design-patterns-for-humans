🎉 Ultra-simplified explanation to design patterns! 🎉

A topic that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick
in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the <i>simplest</i> way
possible.

## Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines for how to
tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages, or libraries that
you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are,
rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

Wikipedia describes design patterns as:

> [...] a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a
given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or
template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different
situations.
