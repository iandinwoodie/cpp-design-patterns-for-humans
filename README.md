🎉 Ultra-simplified explanation to design patterns! 🎉
</p>
<p align="center">
A topic that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick
in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the <i>simplest</i> way
possible.

## Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines for how to
tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages, or libraries that
you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are,
rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

> Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines for how to
tackle certain problems.

Wikipedia describes design patterns as:

> [...] a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a
given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or
template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different
situations.

### ⚠️ Be Careful

- Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
- Do not try to force them; bad things are supposed to happen, if done so. 
- Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solutions 
**finding** problems; so don't overthink.
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior;
or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.

## Types of Design Patterns

* [Creational](#creational-design-patterns)
* [Structural](#structural-design-patterns)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral-design-patterns)

## Creational Design Patterns

In plain words:

> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group
of related objects.

Wikipedia says:

> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that
deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner
suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in
design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns
solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

## Structural Design Patterns

In plain words:

> Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other
words how the entities can use each other. Or yet another explanation would be,
they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

Wikipedia says:

> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that
ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between
entities.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

In plain words:

> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What
makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the
structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication
between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior
in software component?"

Wikipedia says:

> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that
identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these
patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this
communication.

## 🚦 Wrap Up

And that about wraps it up. I will continue to improve this, so you might want
to watch/star this repository to revisit. Also, I have plans on writing the same
about the architectural patterns, stay tuned for it.
